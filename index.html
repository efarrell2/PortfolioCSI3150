                Hello, my name is Emma Farrell. I am currently a senior at Oakland University, though I still have a handful of semesters's worth of classes left. I transferred to OU from Oakland Community College two years ago, and have since changed my major to Information Technology. As of right now, I don't have a specialization selected, and am actively researching my options and what will be best for me. I am very interested in coding projects, and hope to hone my skills in my remaining time here at OU. I always strive to learn as much as I can, and to do as much as I can with what I know! To learn more about me, check out my <a href="./html/my_resume.html">Resume</a> and <a href="./html/my_fun_facts.html">Fun Facts</a> pages.
